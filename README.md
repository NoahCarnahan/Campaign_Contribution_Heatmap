Campaign Contribution Heatmap
=============================

## Setup

To run this project, a sql server needs to be running on localhost:8889 (this configuration can of course be changed in the source). I used [MAMP](www.mamp.info/â€Ž) for this purpose. Unfortunately, the .sql files that should be imported into this database are too large for github. I'm currently working out an alternative solution...

## Sources
The contribution data was obtained from [OpenSectrets.org](http://www.opensecrets.org) and the Center for Responsive Politics.

The geolocation data for zip codes was obtained from [GeoNames](http://www.geonames.org).
